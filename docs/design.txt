* DAO always raises an execption on error

* DAO are agnostic of the model.

* Partitions are used canonicalized only

* Id are integer. DAO has to convert it.  Same for quota,  number of files access

* Timestamps are datetime.

* DAOs are distinguished on the RPC-Level.

* Services never call another service, but multiple DAOs
